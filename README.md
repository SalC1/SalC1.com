# SalC1.com
This is the GitHub page for the SalC1 website. I decided to make all changes to my website public for a few reasons:
1. Better organization of site changes.
2. Can recieve suggestions for site changes.
3. Others can use the code from this site to improve their own website projects.

Update Jan. 23 2024:
Adding my site to Github is on hold until further notice.
